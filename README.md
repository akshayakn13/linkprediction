Link Prediction for social networks.
Any code related queries feel free to mail me at akshayakn95@gmail.com

A couple years ago, Facebook launched a link prediction contest on Kaggle, with the goal of recommending missing edges in a social network graph. Social Networks mainly focus on building social relations among users who share common interests, background, real-life connections,etc. People may or may not want to maximize their social influence. For example, a business page owners on instagram want to influence as many people as possible for their commercial advantages.However, the network is evolving in time, new users are joining, adding friends, new connections between old users,etc.Based on the current network we want to be able to predict the upcoming changes in the network and make recommendations accordingly.

Facebook has provided a snapshot of its social network at time(say ‘t’) and based on it, we need to predict the future possible links. This is my approach to this case study
